This program, Productivity Timer, is meant to be a timer that works in intervals. You can use it for many purposes, but it is mostly to made
to make large periods of tiring or monotonous work more mangeable by including breaks in it. It incorporates sounds to indicate 
each period's pass and also a visual representation of the timer going down. 

To run the Productivity Timer, first make sure to only input integers. Since the program only works in minutes, be sure that you are
sure that you want to run that amount of minutes. The limit is 9000. That means nothing, but it could be useful information.

You will get the prompt 3 times: One for time for productivity, one for work, and one for rest, and another for the amount of times you want
to repeat those two steps.
